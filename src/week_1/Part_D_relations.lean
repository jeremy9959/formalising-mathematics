# Equivalence relations are the same as partitions

In this file we prove that there's a bijection between
the equivalence relations on a type, and the partitions of a type. 

Three sections:

1) partitions
2) equivalence classes
3) the proof

## Overview

Say `α` is a type, and `R : α → α → Prop` is a binary relation on `α`. 
The following things are already in Lean:

`reflexive R := ∀ (x : α), R x x`
`symmetric R := ∀ ⦃x y : α⦄, R x y → R y x`
`transitive R := ∀ ⦃x y z : α⦄, R x y → R y z → R x z`

`equivalence R := reflexive R ∧ symmetric R ∧ transitive R`

In the file below, we will define partitions of `α` and "build some
interface" (i.e. prove some propositions). We will define
equivalence classes and do the same thing.
Finally, we will prove that there's a bijection between
equivalence relations on `α` and partitions of `α`.

# 1) Partitions

We define a partition, and prove some lemmas about partitions. Some
I prove myself (not always using tactics) and some I leave for you.

## Definition of a partition

Let `α` be a type. A *partition* on `α` is defined to be
the following data:

1) A set C of subsets of α, called "blocks".
2) A hypothesis (i.e. a proof!) that all the blocks are non-empty.
3) A hypothesis that every term of type α is in one of the blocks.
4) A hypothesis that two blocks with non-empty intersection are equal.

@[ext] structure partition (α : Type) :=
(C : set (set α))
(Hnonempty : ∀ X ∈ C, (X : set α).nonempty)
(Hcover : ∀ a, ∃ X ∈ C, a ∈ X)
(Hdisjoint : ∀ X Y ∈ C, (X ∩ Y : set α).nonempty → X = Y)

## Basic interface for partitions

Here's the way notation works. If `α` is a type (i.e. a set)
then a term `P` of type `partition α` is a partition of `α`,
that is, a set of disjoint nonempty subsets of `α` whose union is `α`.

The collection of sets underlying `P` is `P.C`, the proof that
they're all nonempty is `P.Hnonempty` and so on.

# 2) Equivalence classes.

We define equivalence classes and prove a few basic results about them.

  -- Note that `hR : equivalence R` is a package of three things.
  -- You can extract the things with

  obtain ⟨ hrefl, hsymm, htrans ⟩ := hR,
  exact hrefl a,

  cl R a ⊆ cl R b :=

# 3) The theorem

Let `α` be a type (i.e. a collection of stucff).

There is a bijection between equivalence relations on `α` and
partitions of `α`.

We prove this by writing down constructions in each direction
and proving that the constructions are two-sided inverses of one another.
