# Injective functions

-- let's start by checking the definition of injective is
-- what we think it is.

lemma injective_def : injective f ↔ ∀ a b : X, f a = f b → a = b :=
begin
  -- true by definition
  refl
end

-- You can now `rw injective_def` to change `injective f` into its definition.

-- The identity function id : X → X is defined by id(x) = x. Let's check this

lemma id_def : id x = x :=
begin
  -- true by definition
  refl
end

-- you can now `rw id_def` to change `id x` into `x`

/-- The identity function is injective -/
lemma injective_id : injective (id : X → X) :=
begin
  -- these rewrites are not necessary, but I'll
  -- put them in just this once
  -- ⊢ injective id
  rw injective_def,
  -- ⊢ ∀ (a b : X), id a = id b → a = b
  intros a b hab,
  -- hab: id a = id b
  -- again another rewrite which isn't actually necessary
  rw id_def at hab, 
  rw id_def at hab, 
  -- hab : a = b
  exact hab,
end

### Surjective functions

-- Let's start by checking the definition of surjectivity is what we think it is

lemma surjective_def : surjective f ↔ ∀ y : Y, ∃ x : X, f x = y :=
begin
  -- true by definition
  refl
end

/-- The identity function is surjective -/
lemma surjective_id : surjective (id : X → X) :=
begin
  -- you can start with `rw surjective_def` if you like.
  intro x,
  use x,
  refl,
end

-- If you started with `rw surjective_def` -- try deleting it.
-- Probably your proof still works! This is because
-- `surjective_def` is true *by definition*. The proof is `refl`.

-- For this next one, the `have` tactic is helpful.

/-- Composite of two surjective functions is surjective -/
lemma surjective_comp (hf : surjective f) (hg : surjective g) : surjective (g ∘ f) :=
begin
  intro z,
  cases hg z with y hy,
  cases hf y with x hx,
  use x,
  show g(f(x)) = z,
  rw hx,
  exact hy,

### Bijective functions

In Lean a function is defined to be bijective if it is injective and surjective.
Let's check this.

-/

lemma bijective_def : bijective f ↔ injective f ∧ surjective f :=
begin
  -- true by definition
  refl
end

-- You can now use the lemmas you've proved already to make these
-- proofs very short.

/-- The identity function is bijective. -/
lemma bijective_id : bijective (id : X → X) :=
begin
  exact ⟨injective_id, surjective_id⟩,
end

/-- A composite of bijective functions is bijective. -/
lemma bijective_comp (hf : bijective f) (hg : bijective g) : bijective (g ∘ f) :=
begin
  cases hf with hf_inj hf_surj,
  cases hg with hg_inj hg_surj,
  exact ⟨injective_comp hf_inj hg_inj, surjective_comp hf_surj hg_surj⟩
end
